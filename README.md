- Add/edit event details directly in the HTML
- Customize styles in `frontend/public/css/style.css`

## Browser Compatibility

2. Create your feature branch
3. Commit your changes
4. Push to the branch

## Admin Access

The default admin credentials are:

- Username: `admin`
- Password: `kosge2023`

**Important:** For security in production, change the login credentials in:

1. `frontend/public/index.html` (search for `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD`)
2. `frontend/public/admin/login.html` (same variables)

## Maintenance

### Adding Languages

1. Create a new HTML file in the `frontend/locales/` directory
2. Update the language selector in `index.html`
3. Add translations to the language configuration

### Image Upload

The admin panel allows uploading images by URL. For best results:

1. Use image hosting services like Cloudinary, Imgur, or Storj
2. Upload your image to the service
3. Copy the direct link to the image
4. Paste it in the admin panel

## Data Storage

Since this is a static website, all data is stored in the browser's localStorage:

- Participant information
- Banner URLs
- Admin authentication

Note that this data is browser-specific and will be lost if the user clears their browser data.
